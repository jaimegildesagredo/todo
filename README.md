# Todo
Sample TODO app to show how to create a web application with Tornado and Cormoran.

## Try it!
To run the sample application you need to have Python installed in your system. To install the application dependencies I recommend you to use virtualenv.

    $ virtualenv todo-env
    $ source todo-env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now, your virtual environment is ready to launch the application, just type:

    $ python launcher.py
